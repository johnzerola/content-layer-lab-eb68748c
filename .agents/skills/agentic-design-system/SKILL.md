# Agentic Design System

you have a design system installed. this skill orchestrates it. read this BEFORE starting any visual work.

## Workflows (runnable runbooks)

if you just want to *use* ADS, start at `workflows/create-design-workflow.md` — it routes a task
to the right profile or workflow by intent. each runbook is decision-shaped (when to use, read
first, run, evidence, output, blocked when, stop when). these ship with this skill at
`<skills-root>/agentic-design-system/workflows/` so installed agents have them, not just repo clones;
the canonical copies live at the repo root `workflows/` and the two are kept in sync by the
install smoke's drift guard.

> **Installed, not cloned? Read this.** Resolve shared files from the directory containing this
> `SKILL.md`; that location is portable even when agents use different install roots. From this
> file:
> - `workflows/create-design-workflow.md` → `./workflows/create-design-workflow.md`
> - portable capture command → `node ./scripts/run-capture.mjs <url> ...`
> - `<skills-root>/design-review/references/mobile.md` resolves from every supported installer root
> - `templates/run-report-template.md` → `./templates/run-report-template.md`
> - `templates/project-identity-template.md` → `./templates/project-identity-template.md`
> - `templates/reference-intake-contract.md` → `./templates/reference-intake-contract.md`
> - visual foundation contract → `./contracts/visual-foundation.v2.json`
> - routing contract → `./routing/ROUTING.md`
> - starter presets → `./presets/`

## How it works

the system installs a routing skill plus focused helper skills. you don't need to read them all — this file tells you which ones to read for your current task.

### core pack (read these for ALL visual work)
- `<skills-root>/design-review/SKILL.md` — quality gate, reference files, verification scripts
- `<skills-root>/ux-baseline-check/SKILL.md` — loading, empty, error states
- `<skills-root>/ui-polish-pass/SKILL.md` — final spacing/alignment/hierarchy pass

### creative pack (read ONLY when triggered)
- `<skills-root>/visual-reference-calibration/SKILL.md` — BEFORE coding when the user provides a screenshot, CodePen, website, or other artifact as a desired visual target, or says “make it feel like this.” A screenshot used only to point at a defect is review evidence, not a reference target. Write the Reference Intake Contract first so the agent knows what to borrow, what not to borrow, and the fidelity target.
- `<skills-root>/design-variations/SKILL.md` — BEFORE production implementation when the user asks for options, variations, concepts, mockups, or help choosing a direction. Build one disposable browser artifact, let the human choose or blend, then promote only the winner.
- `<skills-root>/whimsical-design/SKILL.md` — ONLY if user asks for personality, delight, or brand expression. ONLY for marketing, editorial, or launch pages. Skip for utility UI.
- `<skills-root>/world-build/SKILL.md` — ONLY if user explicitly asks for immersion or atmosphere. Skip unless told otherwise.
- `<skills-root>/web-animation-design/SKILL.md` — ONLY if task specifically involves animation, motion, or interaction feel.

### agent-friendly (read for production sites)
- `<skills-root>/agent-friendly-design/SKILL.md` — semantic HTML, ARIA, structured data. Read when building anything that ships to production.

### project knowledge intake (optional; run when context needs alignment)
default path: use a preset when there is no project context, then build. if the task depends on product taste and a preset is not enough, inspect local docs/components/screenshots/references, ask only the missing blocking questions, and write the result into `DESIGN.md` or the `templates/project-identity-template.md` shape so downstream skills can use it. installed copies live under this skill's `templates/` directory.

### reference intake gate (optional; run before reference-led visual work)
if the user provides a visual reference/screenshot/site/CodePen as a desired target, says “make it feel like…”, the work is marketing/editorial/launch art direction, or prior output failed because it was generic/sloppy/wrong vibe, load `<skills-root>/visual-reference-calibration/SKILL.md` before generating UI. screenshots used only to identify a bug or region of concern stay in the normal review path.

use `templates/reference-intake-contract.md`; installed copies live under this skill's `templates/` directory. hard rule for reference-led work: if you cannot state what to borrow, what not to borrow, and the fidelity target, you cannot build. if no visual reference matters, skip this gate. ask before building when the primary borrowed layer or fidelity target is unclear, when the reference implies unapproved structural change, or when the user already said the prior pass missed the point. after implementation, screenshot the result and report where it matched or drifted from the contract.

### outcome + grader loop (optional; run for substantial UI work)
for non-trivial UI, define the user-facing intent and outcome before building, then grade the artifact in a separate context when possible.

use `templates/outcome-template.md` and `templates/grader-report-template.md` from the full repo. installed copies of all five runtime templates — outcome, project identity, reference intake, grader report, and run report — are bundled under this skill's `templates/` directory.

minimum loop:

1. define **intent**: user/situation, accomplish, notice, feel/operational state, alignment check
2. define **done**: artifact, required evidence, deterministic checks, max iterations
3. build
4. attach evidence: changed files, checks, screenshots or preview, unresolved risks
5. grade against the outcome using a separate agent/context when available
6. stop at `satisfied`, `max_iterations`, or explicit human decision

do not turn this into ceremony for tiny fixes. use it when unclear intent, visual quality, reference fidelity, or regression risk would otherwise cause churn.

### decision provenance (optional; substantial work only)

when a reviewer needs inspectable causality, read `workflows/decision-provenance.md`. capture the
loaded skill/source hashes once after routing and before building, then verify 3-7 consequential
decisions once at report time. do not trace every CSS property or repeat provenance capture inside
the revision loop.

skip this for copy-only changes, tiny mechanical fixes, and routine polish unless the user or risk
profile explicitly requires traceability. the provenance path has a 250ms budget per deterministic
operation and adds zero agent, model, browser, or network calls.

## Project handoff context (DESIGN.md)

if a `DESIGN.md` file exists at the repo root — or at a path the orchestrator passes in — load it as handoff context **before** building. it is the normative source of truth for design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, rounded, components) and a prose overlay for atmosphere, component tone, and anti-goals. if it does not exist and the task needs project taste, run project knowledge intake before generation.

- YAML frontmatter tokens win on conflicts with prose
- prose gives the **why** so the agent can judge edge cases
- unknown sections are preserved without error per the spec, so this repo's one extension (`Example Prompting Language`) is safe to use

the project-identity template is DESIGN.md-shaped. source checkouts use `templates/project-identity-template.md`; installed agents use the copy under this skill's `templates/` directory.

## Routing decision

```
is this visual or frontend work?
├── no → skip everything, do the task
└── yes
    ├── new page/component → run project knowledge intake if context is thin, read core pack skills, then build
    ├── modification to existing UI → read design-review only
    └── non-visual (scripts, backend, config) → skip
    
    does it need creative direction?
    ├── user provided a desired visual reference/screenshot/CodePen/site/"feel like this" → also read visual-reference-calibration BEFORE coding
    ├── user asked for options/variations/concepts or the direction is undecided → run design-variations BEFORE production implementation
    ├── user asked for personality/delight → also read whimsical-design
    ├── user asked for immersion/atmosphere → also read world-build  
    ├── task involves animation specifically → also read web-animation-design
    └── none of the above → core pack is enough
```

## The key rule

if the default aesthetic is appropriate for the product, don't fight it. make it excellent, not different. a weather app CAN be dark and glassy. an admin panel SHOULD be clean and utilitarian. core pack makes defaults excellent. creative pack makes them different. only add creative when different is what the product actually needs.

## Visual foundation profile

lock the profile before generation. read `contracts/visual-foundation.v2.json`; installed copies
live under this skill's `contracts/` directory.

- **utility** — product interfaces, admin and operations surfaces, settings, workflows, and
  internal tools. use the existing product family, a system sans, or another conventional
  general-purpose family by default. weights are Functionality 35, Design Quality 30, Craft 25,
  and Originality 10.
- **expressive** — marketing, editorial, landing, launch, and brief-approved brand expression.
  weights are Design Quality 35, Originality 30, Craft 20, and Functionality 15.

the expressive profile requires an eligible surface or an explicit outcome. agents cannot promote
utility work into expressive mode because it feels visually plain. utility Originality means
product-specific decisions without generic software tropes; it does not mean decorative novelty.

the visual foundation contract also governs rendered anti-agent evidence. confirmed violations of
its `never` rules block presentation. report-only measurements remain review candidates until their
fixture precision is proven.

## Design rubric (grade yourself before presenting)

score your output on the same four criteria using the locked profile's weights.

| Criteria | Utility | Expressive | What it means |
|----------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Functionality** | 35% | 15% | Users understand the state, primary task, actions, and recovery path. |
| **Design Quality** | 30% | 35% | Hierarchy, layout, color, spacing, and type form a coherent whole. |
| **Craft** | 25% | 20% | Typography, spacing, contrast, interaction states, and responsive behavior are competent. |
| **Originality** | 10% | 30% | Decisions fit the product and avoid generic agent tropes; expressive work also needs a brief-supported point of view. |

### scoring guide
- **8-10:** ship it. would impress a human designer.
- **6-7:** functional but needs another pass. common for first iteration.
- **4-5:** generic AI slop. needs a creative pivot, not polish.
- **1-3:** broken fundamentals. rebuild.

**below 6 on Functionality or Design Quality blocks either profile. below 6 on Originality blocks
the expressive profile; utility work uses the contract and independent review to reject generic
tropes without forcing novelty.**

## Iteration philosophy

more iterations with structured feedback produce breakthroughs. Anthropic's harness research found that on iteration 10 of a museum site, the model reimagined the entire approach as a 3D spatial experience — something that would never emerge from a single pass.

**rules for iteration:**
- don't stop at "good enough" on creative work. push for at least 3 passes on new pages/components.
- after each pass, score yourself on the rubric. if Design Quality or Originality aren't improving, **pivot the aesthetic entirely** instead of refining the current direction.
- refinement and pivoting are both valid. if scores trend up, refine. if scores plateau, pivot.
- the "2 rounds of fixes = rebuild" rule applies to BUG FIXES, not creative iteration. creative exploration benefits from more rounds, not fewer.

## Verification (run before presenting)

after ingest/interview (if needed), building, and scoring yourself on the rubric, run these source pre-flight scripts. replace `<skills-root>` with the directory containing the installed skill folders:

```bash
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/anti-pattern-check.py <file.tsx>
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/state-check.py <file.tsx>
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/accessibility-check.py <file.tsx>
node <skills-root>/agentic-design-system/scripts/run-capture.mjs <running-route-url> --states default,loading,empty,error --out evidence/<slug>
```

investigate source warnings before presenting work. source heuristics are advisory and gameable.
rendered evidence is authoritative for established gates. evidence format 2 additionally records
rounded one-edge borders, one-edge shadow candidates, forced uppercase, typography outliers,
symbol-only controls, status-dot candidates, divider count, colons, and em dashes. those new fields
remain report-only in this release.

the rendered capture writes a deterministic `modal-interaction-receipt.json`. when dialogs are
declared, every dialog must be reachable through a visible enabled `aria-controls` trigger and
pass focus, containment, Escape, focus-return, and inert-background checks. `failed`,
`not_verified`, or a missing receipt blocks `satisfied`. motion-bearing hover rules without
fine-pointer capability gates remain report-only during calibration.

## What the reference files cover

when you read `<skills-root>/design-review/SKILL.md`, it points to reference files in `<skills-root>/design-review/references/`. you don't need to read all of them — only load what's relevant:

- `anti-patterns.md` — what NOT to do (always worth reading)
- `layout.md` — composition and grid-breaking (read for new pages)
- `typography.md` — type hierarchy, pairing, text-wrap (read when type feels off)
- `color.md` — palette strategy, tinted neutrals (read when color feels generic)
- `spacing.md` — rhythm and judgment (read when spacing feels cramped or uniform)
- `alignment.md` — concentric radius, optical alignment, shadows, image overlays (read for polish)
- `responsive.md` — mobile failures and what to check (read for responsive work)
- `mobile.md` — mobile review profile: design-judgment vs platform-defect passes, decision forks, severity tiers (read for mobile/app/PWA review)
- `motion.md` — interruptibility, enter/exit asymmetry, and the named motion vocabulary (read when adding or reviewing motion)
- `ux-writing.md` — copy quality, button labels, empty states (read when writing UI text)
- `mock-data.md` — realistic content, where humor goes (read when generating sample data)
- `inspiration.md` — context pass, reference priority (read when building for a named company)
- `structured-findings.md` — diagnostic categories, severity, evidence, and recurrence rules (read for substantial independent review)

## Structured diagnostic findings

the four weighted rubric criteria remain the verdict layer. for substantial UI review, the
independent grader must also return structured findings that explain why a score failed and exactly
where the failure appears. read `references/structured-findings.md` for the complete schema.

each finding records:

- `category`: `layout_spacing_hierarchy`, `polish_consistency`, `typography`, `originality`, `color_contrast`, `interaction_motion`, `cues_affordances`, or `brand_fit_tone`
- `severity`: `minor`, `major`, or `blocker`
- `rubricRow`: Design Quality, Originality, Craft, Functionality, or a task-specific criterion
- `state` and `breakpoint`
- `artifact`: the screenshot or preview actually judged
- `target`: a concrete element description, plus an optional normalized bounding box
- `observation`: one specific, falsifiable failure statement
- `evidence`: the screenshot path, comparison, interaction receipt, or rendered measurement supporting it

do not replace the four rubric scores with the diagnostic categories. do not turn a subjective
label into a deterministic hard gate. a blocker finding forces `needs_revision` or `failed`, and
every blocker or major finding must feed a bounded next-revision instruction.

account for review coverage separately from findings. return one evidenced row for each of the
eight categories with status `clear`, `finding`, or `not_reviewed`. use `not_reviewed` when the
artifact cannot support a judgment. there is no minimum finding count.

### adjacent-action consistency check

before a revision closes or an independent grader returns `satisfied`, run this sweep in every
changed state and breakpoint:

1. name the state contract and what actions it permits
2. inspect every visible nearby primary, secondary, toolbar, and inline action, not only the target
   named by the finding
3. verify each action's label, visual emphasis, enabledness, native semantics, and helper text agree
   with the state and its instructions
4. when the state is read-only, disabled, offline, permission-limited, or destructive, remove,
   disable, relabel, or explain any action that would contradict it; use native `disabled`
   semantics when the control remains visible
5. preserve active actions in unaffected states

run this in both the builder's revision instruction and the independent regrade. an enabled-looking
contradictory action is a `cues_affordances` major finding and prevents `satisfied` until repaired.

aggregate findings by category and severity across iterations. repeated findings become candidates
for a rule, constraint, fixture, or deterministic gate only after a human or verified recurrence
establishes the pattern. preserve the finding → revision → evidence trace in the run report.

## Compounding

after each build, if you learned something new — a pattern that worked, an anti-pattern you hit, a design decision worth preserving — add it to the relevant reference file. the system gets smarter every time it's used.

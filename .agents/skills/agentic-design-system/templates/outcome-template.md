# outcome

define this before the agent starts building. outcome is the work contract: what artifact is being produced, how it will be judged, when the loop stops, and when a human needs to step in.

---

## header

- **task:** one-line user request
- **slug:** short stable id
- **artifact:** route, component, file path, screenshot set, or prototype URL
- **owner agent:** builder model / lane
- **grader agent:** separate model / lane, if available
- **visual foundation profile:** `utility` / `expressive` with eligibility reason
- **created:** ISO 8601
- **max iterations:** 2 for fixes, 3 for normal UI, 5 for creative/reference-heavy work
- **status:** `defined` / `building` / `grading` / `needs_revision` / `satisfied` / `max_iterations` / `failed`

## intent

define the user-facing intent before defining done.

- **user / situation:** who this is for and what just happened
- **accomplish:** what the user needs to do, decide, understand, or trust
- **notice:** what the UI must make obvious first
- **feel / operational state:** the state the UI should create, such as confident enough to decide, calm enough to inspect, oriented enough to compare, or safe enough to edit
- **alignment check:** does what they notice create the right operational state, and does that state support what they need to accomplish?

## outcome

what does done mean?

example:

> improve `/settings/billing` until it is demo-ready: clear hierarchy, complete loading/empty/error states, no obvious AI-default styling, accessible controls, and screenshot evidence at desktop and mobile.

## artifact contract

| item | required |
|---|---|
| changed files listed | yes / no |
| screenshots or preview link | yes / no |
| deterministic checks | yes / no |
| run report | yes / no |
| grader report | yes / no |

## rubric

lock the profile before generation using `contracts/visual-foundation.v2.json`. score 1-10 unless
a criterion is pass/fail.

| criterion | utility | expressive | pass condition |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Functionality | 35% | 15% | primary task and state transitions are understandable |
| Design Quality | 30% | 35% | coherent visual system; hierarchy, layout, color, and spacing feel intentional |
| Craft | 25% | 20% | spacing, typography, contrast, hover/focus, responsive behavior are competent |
| Originality | 10% | 30% | avoids obvious AI defaults and shows product-specific choices; expressive work also has a brief-supported point of view |
| State coverage | pass/fail | pass/fail | loading, empty, and error states exist or are explicitly not applicable |
| Accessibility | pass/fail | pass/fail | semantic structure, focus paths, labels, alt text, and contrast clear the scripts/review |
| Evidence | pass/fail | pass/fail | report, screenshots/preview, and verification commands are present |

## hard stops

- Functionality or Design Quality below 6 -> `needs_revision`
- Originality below 6 on creative or marketing work -> `needs_revision` or `pivot`
- any confirmed visual-foundation `never` rule -> `needs_revision`
- missing required state with no stated reason -> `needs_revision`
- accessibility warning left unresolved -> `needs_revision` unless human accepts it
- vague intent words like "delight", "empower", or "confidence" fail unless tied to observable UI evidence
- max iterations reached -> stop and escalate; do not keep patching

## iteration budget

| work type | default max | stop rule |
|---|---:|---|
| bug fix / narrow visual fix | 2 | if still failing, reset diagnosis |
| normal UI/page/component | 3 | if scores plateau, ask for human direction |
| creative/reference-heavy work | 5 | if Design Quality or Originality plateau, pivot aesthetic |

## grader instructions

the grader must be a separate context from the builder when possible. the grader reads:

1. this outcome
2. the artifact/report/screenshots
3. relevant `DESIGN.md` or project identity
4. verification output

the grader does not rewrite code. it returns `templates/grader-report-template.md` in a repo clone
or `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/grader-report-template.md` from an installed pack.

## event log

append one line per loop event.

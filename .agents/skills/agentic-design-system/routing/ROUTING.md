# Routing

how to decide which skills to run and when.

> Runnable entrypoint: [`workflows/create-design-workflow.md`](../workflows/create-design-workflow.md)
> routes a task into the right profile or workflow by intent. this doc is the decision logic; the
> [`workflows/`](../workflows/) runbooks are operational wrappers around it.

Path terms below are install-root neutral. `<orchestrator-skill>` is the installed
agentic-design-system directory and `<skills-root>` is its parent directory.

## Profile lock before generation

Read `contracts/visual-foundation.v2.json` and lock one profile before build or grading. Installed
agents use the copy under the orchestrator skill.

- **utility** is the default for product interfaces, admin and operations surfaces, settings,
  workflows, and internal tools. Use the product font, a system sans, or another conventional
  general-purpose family. Grade Functionality 35, Design Quality 30, Craft 25, Originality 10.
- **expressive** is available only for marketing, editorial, landing, launch, or explicit
  brief-approved brand expression. Grade Design Quality 35, Originality 30, Craft 20,
  Functionality 15.

An agent cannot promote utility work to expressive mode merely because the conventional result
feels plain. The selected preset records its profile as `visualFoundationProfile`.

## Three lanes

**core pack** (always active for visual work):
- design-review — quality gate
- ux-baseline-check — state completeness
- ui-polish-pass — final visual polish

**production pass** (for public sites and products):
- agent-friendly-design — semantic structure and machine-readable state for AI consumers

**creative pack** (opt-in only):
- visual-reference-calibration — reference contract before generation
- whimsical-design — personality and delight
- world-build — immersive atmosphere
- web-animation-design — motion and interaction feel

core pack runs on every visual task. the production pass runs when a web surface will ship. creative pack runs only when triggered. each creative skill has its own trigger rules in its SKILL.md — read those, not just this doc.

## The decision

```
is this visual or user-facing?
├── no → skip (scripts, backend, config, data)
└── yes → core pack always runs
    │
    will this web surface ship publicly or as a product?
    ├── yes → also run agent-friendly-design
    └── no → skip the production pass
    │
    does it need creative direction?
    ├── desired visual reference/screenshot/site/CodePen/"feel like" prompt → add visual-reference-calibration BEFORE generation
    ├── user asked for personality/delight/whimsy → add whimsical-design
    ├── user asked for immersion/atmosphere/world → add world-build
    ├── user asked about animation/motion/feel → add web-animation-design
    ├── it's marketing/launch/portfolio/editorial → whimsical-design likely helps
    └── none of the above → core pack is enough
```

**the key rule:** if the default aesthetic is appropriate for the product, don't fight it. a weather app CAN be dark and glassy. an admin panel SHOULD be clean and utilitarian. "different from defaults" is not always better. core pack makes the defaults excellent. creative pack makes them different. only add creative when different is actually what the product needs.

## Project Knowledge Intake (optional; run when alignment is needed)

default path: use a preset when there is no project context, then build. run Project Knowledge Intake only when the task depends on product taste and the project needs shared context beyond a preset.

intake gathers:
- brand/design docs, product specs, and prior decisions
- existing components, tokens, routes, and screenshots
- audience, domain nouns, workflows, and product language
- visual references and anti-references
- constraints: accessibility, responsive behavior, performance, libraries, launch risk

then ask only the minimum clarifying questions needed to remove blocking ambiguity. do not interview when files already answer the question. emit or update a project identity brief using `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/project-identity-template.md`, then continue with the normal chain.

order: **ingest/interview → generate → critique → verify → report**.

## Outcome + Grader Loop (optional; run for substantial UI work)

use this when a UI task has enough ambiguity or risk that the agent should not self-clear final quality. define the outcome before building, attach evidence after building, and grade from a separate context when possible.

templates:
- `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/outcome-template.md`
- `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/grader-report-template.md`

trigger when:
- the user-facing intent is easy to blur
- a visual regression would be expensive
- a reference or taste target needs explicit judgment
- multiple agents are involved
- the work will be shared, demoed, or used as proof

skip for:
- tiny copy fixes
- mechanical bug fixes with obvious pass/fail behavior
- non-visual work

order: **intent/outcome → build → evidence → separate grader → revise or stop**.

## Reference Intake Gate (optional; run when a visual target matters)

if the prompt includes a desired visual reference, screenshot, site, CodePen, Dribbble shot, “make it feel like…”, marketing/editorial/launch art direction, or a previous output failed because the vibe was generic/sloppy/wrong, run `visual-reference-calibration` before building. a screenshot used only to point at a defect is review evidence, not a visual target, and does not trigger this gate.

create `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/reference-intake-contract.md` or the same shape in the run report. the contract must state:
- source/reference
- primary borrowed layer: structure, scale, motion, mood, typography, art style, surface, or interaction model
- secondary borrowed layers, if any
- what not to borrow
- fidelity target: close mimic, same spirit, or loose cue
- product constraints
- success cues and failure cues

hard rule for reference-led work: if the agent cannot state what to borrow, what not to borrow, and the fidelity target, it cannot build. if the task is not reference-led, skip this gate.

ask before building when:
- the primary borrowed layer is unclear
- the fidelity target is unclear and would change implementation strategy
- the reference implies structural change but the user did not approve it
- the user already said the prior pass missed the point

done gate for reference-led work:
1. screenshot the result
2. compare against the reference contract when cheap/easy
3. report where it matched and where it drifted

order for reference-led work: **project knowledge intake (if needed) → reference intake contract → generate → critique → screenshot comparison → report**.

## Context pass (run first if applicable)

if the prompt names a real company, product, founder, or public figure:

0. **contextual grounding** — BEFORE anything else, research the named entity. study their actual product's visual language (layout, nav, typography, color, density, interaction style). identify 10-20 real nouns from their domain. determine the premise's tone (satirical? deadpan? earnest?). write a brief: "this should feel like [company]'s actual product, with [tone] energy, using [real nouns]."

rules:
- the named company's product IS the primary visual reference. not Stripe. not Linear. not "best in class SaaS."
- generic references (Mobbin, Godly) are secondary — use them only to fill gaps the source product doesn't cover
- if the prompt is satirical or parodic, the humor should live in the DATA (row names, statuses, labels, timestamps) not in the visual design. the UI should look real; the content should be funny.
- mock data must be current: real model names, real agencies, real features, plausible scenarios
- ask: "would someone who works at this company recognize this as their tool?" if no, you're building the wrong thing.

skip this step only if the prompt is generic (no named entities).

## Core chain (default for all visual work)

run in order:

0. **project knowledge intake** — when context is incomplete, gather or interview enough to create/update the project identity brief before building.
1. **pattern benchmarking** — BEFORE building, research how the best version of this already exists. read `<skills-root>/design-review/references/inspiration.md`. find 2-3 real examples via Mobbin/Godly. this step takes 2 minutes and saves 30 minutes of iteration.
2. **design-review** — quality gate. catches structural problems, anti-patterns, missing states.
3. **ux-baseline-check** — state inventory. happy path, empty, loading, error, edge cases.
4. **ui-polish-pass** — final polish. spacing, alignment, hierarchy, visual cleanup.

## Core + creative (only when triggered)

add creative skills on top of core when the triggers are met:

- **+ whimsical-design** — when user asks for personality, delight, or brand expression. when building marketing/editorial/launch pages. when the output needs to be screenshotable.
- **+ world-build** — when user explicitly asks for immersion or atmosphere. portfolio sites, product launches, game UIs. runs BEFORE the core chain (sets creative direction first).
- **+ web-animation-design** — when user asks about motion, easing, springs, interaction feel, or "make it smooth." when the task specifically involves animation work.

## Review only

for modifications to existing UI where the structure already exists.

run:
1. **design-review** — pre-flight checklist
2. **before/after rendered evidence** — required for meaningful visual modifications
   (anything beyond a pure copy fix or a single specified value change). capture the
   baseline from the pre-change revision (merge-base worktree, production URL, or the
   unmodified route) and the candidate from the change, with the **same states and
   breakpoints**, then compare:

```bash
node <orchestrator-skill>/scripts/run-capture.mjs "<baseline-url>"  --states ... --out evidence/<slug>-baseline
node <orchestrator-skill>/scripts/run-capture.mjs "<candidate-url>" --states ... --out evidence/<slug>-candidate
node <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/compare.mjs evidence/<slug>-baseline evidence/<slug>-candidate
```

the comparison is **evidence, not a verdict**: the report states what changed, what stayed
identical, and whether the delta matches the stated intent — a "polish pass" or a "1:1 port"
with a large unexplained delta is a restructure wearing a polish label. pass `--threshold <pct>`
only when an explicit "nothing should visibly change more than X%" budget was agreed; that is
the only case where the comparison itself fails.

the default metric is "visibly changed" (perceptual tolerance — subtle tint drift does not
register). for strict-fidelity reviews (1:1 ports, polish passes, token adherence) add
`--pixel-threshold 0` so any numeric color drift counts, including anti-aliased pixels; the
pixel threshold and anti-aliasing policy are recorded in `comparison.json`.

skip the compare for: pure copy fixes, changes with no rendered surface, or work where no
baseline exists yet (first build of a screen goes through the core chain instead).

examples: adjusting spacing, updating copy, minor layout tweaks, checking a screen before merge.

## Mobile + motion review

trigger when the task is mobile/responsive review, or names: mobile, responsive, app, PWA,
iOS, Android, safe area, notch, thumb zone/reach, touch targets, gesture, or "review this on a
phone." also trigger the motion pass when the work involves animation/transition/interaction
feel on any surface.

split the review into two passes that stay in separate report sections (read
`<skills-root>/design-review/references/mobile.md`):

1. **design judgment** — opinions, ranked by user impact. thumb reach, focus, navigation
   pattern, density, gesture discoverability, and the mobile decision forks (name the fork,
   state the tradeoff, point to the signal — don't pick silently).
2. **platform verification** — objective defects, severity-tiered P0–P3 with `file:line`.
   viewport, safe area, touch-target size, hover-only bugs, PWA/web defects, perf/layout.

**hard rule:** a preference must never read as a must-fix, and a P0 must never read as a matter
of taste. keep opinions and defects visually distinct in the report.

**motion vocabulary pass:** when reviewing motion, use the named patterns in
`<skills-root>/design-review/references/motion.md` (shared vocabulary). for each animation, name the
pattern, state which job it serves (state / hierarchy / causality / feedback), give default
timing/easing, confirm a reduced-motion fallback, and say what the evidence is. motion that
serves none of the four jobs gets cut. for implementation depth, add `web-animation-design`.

report sections: `<orchestrator-skill>/templates/run-report-template.md` → mobile review + motion vocabulary.

## Agent-friendly pass

for any web project shipping to production where agents may consume or interact with the site. runs independently from the visual quality chain.

1. **agent-friendly-design** — semantic HTML, ARIA, structured data, llms.txt, API-first patterns, crawlability

this skill runs alongside the core chain, not instead of it. a page can need both visual quality (for humans) and agent-friendly design (for agents).

## Skip

don't run the design chain for non-visual work:
- scripts, tests, data migrations
- backend logic, API routes
- config, infrastructure
- anything with no user-facing impact

## Divergent exploration mode

when the user asks for options, variations, concepts, mockups, or help choosing a direction, read
`<skills-root>/design-variations/SKILL.md` before production implementation. use its disposable browser
artifact to diverge without creating long-lived variant architecture.

1. frame the decision and identify the invariant content and state
2. build 3–5 directions with distinct structural or interaction theses in one artifact
3. render every direction at the same desktop and mobile viewports
4. recommend one direction with tradeoffs; the human chooses, blends, or rejects
5. promote only the winner, then run the normal quality chain on production code

use for layout decisions and visual direction. not for button colors.

## Token budget awareness

- only load reference files you actually need
- creative pack skills are short — low token cost when loaded
- web-animation-design has a PRACTICAL-TIPS.md supplement — load only when doing animation work
- if you're doing review-only, one skill file is all you need

## Compounding

after every build or review, capture what worked and what didn't:
- new anti-patterns go in `<skills-root>/design-review/references/anti-patterns.md`
- project-specific decisions go in the project's `guidelines.md` or `DESIGN.md`
- the system gets smarter every time it's used. don't skip this step.

# Design Review Skill

## Core Pack — Always Active
This is a core skill. Apply it on ALL visual and frontend work, no exceptions. You do not need permission or a specific trigger to use this.

## Visual foundation contract

Read `../agentic-design-system/contracts/visual-foundation.v2.json` before build or review.
Confirmed `never` rules block presentation.

- Never put a border on only one edge of a rounded rectangle. A complete perimeter remains valid.
- Never recreate that one-edge treatment with a zero-blur or inset shadow.
- Never force uppercase styling. Authored interface copy uses sentence case or title case, with a
  narrow exception for literal external identifiers that would become inaccurate if changed.
- Never use em dashes in interface copy.
- Never use static or animated status dots. Status remains readable without color; add an icon only
  when it materially improves scanning or comprehension.
- Use a real icon when a control has an icon equivalent. Preserve one coherent project family;
  otherwise use licensed Nucleo or one open family, never a mix.
- Utility work starts with the product font, a system sans, or another conventional general-purpose
  family. Expressive typography requires an eligible surface or an explicit outcome.
- Custom letter spacing and line height come from a declared type role, not decorative improvisation.
- Avoid colons in interface copy when a normal phrase works. Literal time, links, code, protocols,
  structured data, and verbatim external data remain valid.
- Use whitespace and grouping before adding dividers. Divider density stays an independent review
  judgment rather than a brittle automatic gate.

## When to Use
- Before presenting ANY visual or UX work.
- Treat this as a quality gate, not optional polish.
- Sub-agents doing design/frontend work MUST run this before announcing completion.

## Pre-Work: Read Before Building

### 1. Read the project's guidelines
- Read `guidelines.md` or equivalent design system doc first if it exists.
- Follow the project's existing components, tokens, and patterns before inventing anything.
- If no formal guidelines exist, inspect the existing product and match its logic.

### 2. Research before designing
- Check how similar tools solve the same problem before inventing a pattern.
- Use proven references when they exist.
- Quality bar references:
  - UX Tools — editorial restraint, typography, calm hierarchy
  - Inflight by Ridd — motion, depth, data viz polish
  - Linear — dense information, excellent hierarchy, no noise
  - Vercel dashboard — spacing, typography, dark mode discipline

### 3. Check design memory
- If the project keeps prior design decisions or rejected patterns, read its `DESIGN.md`, guidelines,
  or decision log before building. Skip this step when no project-owned record exists.
- If memory says the user rejected a pattern, don't repeat it.
- Follow any project-owned source linked from that record.

## Core principles
- Restraint IS the design.
- Spacing is the #1 tell.
- Typography hierarchy > color for information architecture.
- Match references at pixel level before adding your own ideas.
- Existing patterns > new patterns.
- Interactive elements should feel polished, not dead.
- If the foundation is wrong, no polish fixes it.
- Good design is centripetal, not centrifugal.

## Reference Files
Read only what the task needs. Keep this SKILL lean, load detail on demand:

- `references/typography.md` — hierarchy, scale, pairing, measure
- `references/color.md` — restrained palettes, tinted neutrals, contrast, OKLCH
- `references/spacing.md` — spacing system, rhythm, grouping, layout density
- `references/motion.md` — timing, easing, reduced motion, interactive feel, named motion vocabulary
- `references/mobile.md` — mobile review profile: design-judgment vs platform-defect passes, decision forks, severity tiers
- `references/anti-patterns.md` — common agent patterns to reject
- `references/ux-writing.md` — interface copy, terminology consistency, labels, errors, and empty states

### For sub-agents
- Read the relevant reference files based on what you're building.
- New layout or dashboard? Read spacing + anti-patterns.
- Type-heavy screen? Read typography + spacing.
- Color or theming work? Read color + anti-patterns.
- Interactive polish? Read motion + anti-patterns.
- Mobile / responsive / app / PWA review? Read mobile + responsive.
- Interface copy or competing names for the same concept? Read ux-writing.
- If in doubt, at minimum read spacing + anti-patterns.

## Pre-Flight Checklist
Run this every time before presenting work.

### Step 1: Visual verification
- [ ] Take a screenshot of the rendered result.
- [ ] Compare side-by-side with the reference if one exists.
- [ ] Check the target viewport, not an arbitrary devtools width.
- [ ] Exercise reachable modal surfaces. Verify initial focus, Tab and Shift+Tab containment,
  Escape dismissal, focus return, and inert background content. If the capture cannot open the
  modal through a visible enabled `aria-controls` trigger, record `not verified`. A `failed` or
  `not verified` required dialog blocks completion.

### Step 2: Design audit
- [ ] Spacing check — enough breathing room? Default to more.
- [ ] Color check — did you add color that wasn't necessary?
- [ ] Typography check — is hierarchy clear without leaning on color?
- [ ] Pattern check — are you using the project's existing components?
- [ ] Interaction check — hover, focus, active states exist and feel intentional.
- [ ] Terminology check — each user-facing concept has one primary name; aliases are introduced
  once and do not compete with the primary term.
- [ ] Integrity check — no placeholders, dead states, broken assets, or missing data handling.

### Step 3: Honesty check
- [ ] Is it actually done?
- [ ] Does it meet the brief, not an adjacent brief?
- [ ] Would this hold up in a cold review?

### Step 4: Run source pre-flight scripts
if you have access to the scripts directory, run these advisory checks before presenting. replace
`<skills-root>` with the directory containing the installed skill folders:

```bash
# check for common agent anti-patterns
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/anti-pattern-check.py <your-file.tsx>

# verify loading, empty, and error states exist
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/state-check.py <your-file.tsx>

# check semantic HTML, aria labels, alt text, heading hierarchy
python3 <skills-root>/design-review/scripts/accessibility-check.py <your-file.tsx>
```

investigate the warnings before presenting. these checks grep source and are intentionally cheap and gameable; a comment containing “loading, empty, error” can satisfy the state check without rendering any state. they advise, but they do not clear the work.

when visual verification is in scope, run the authoritative rendered capture:

```bash
node <skills-root>/agentic-design-system/scripts/run-capture.mjs "<running-route-url>" \
  --states default,loading,empty,error --out evidence/<slug>
```

gate the verdict on the established rendered fields. evidence format 2 also records rounded one-edge
borders, one-edge shadow candidates, forced uppercase, typography outliers, symbol-only controls,
status-dot candidates, divider count, colons, and em dashes. those new measurements remain
report-only until their fixture precision is proven.

the rendered capture writes `modal-interaction-receipt.json` and mirrors its summary at
`evidence.json#gates.modalInteractions`. every declared `aria-modal="true"` surface must be
reachable through a deterministic visible enabled `aria-controls` trigger and pass initial-focus,
Tab/Shift+Tab containment, Escape dismissal, focus-return, and inert-background checks. `failed`,
`not_verified`, or a missing receipt blocks completion. captures with no declared dialogs record
`required=false` and pass this gate. motion-bearing `:hover` rules that lack
`(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` remain report-only during calibration.

for CI integration, copy `ci/design-eval.py` and `ci/design-eval.yml` into your project to run all three checks on every PR.

### Step 5: Present with evidence
- Screenshot of the result
- What you referenced
- Known gaps or uncertainties
- Link to live/deployed version if applicable

## Updating This Skill
- After the user gives design feedback, capture it.
- Add redirects to `references/anti-patterns.md` or the relevant reference file.
- Add project-specific decisions to `DESIGN.md`, guidelines, or the project decision log.
- Goal: don't get the same design feedback twice.
